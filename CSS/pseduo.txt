What are Pseudo-classes?
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

For example, it can be used to:

Style an element when a user moves the mouse over it
Style visited and unvisited links differently
Style an element when it gets focus
Style valid/invalid/required/optional form elements

:active	a:active	Selects the active link

:first-child	p:first-child
li:first-child	Selects the element that is the first child of its parent (among a group of sibling elements)

:first-of-type	p:first-of-type
li:first-of-type	Selects the first element of its type among a group of sibling elements

:hover	a:hover
p:hover	Selects element on mouse over
:last-child	li:last-child	Selects any <li> element that is the last child of its parent

:last-of-type	p:last-of-type	Selects any <p> element that is the last <p> element of its parent

:not()	:not(p)	Selects any element that is not a <p> element

:nth-child()	p:nth-child(2)	Selects any <p> element that is the second child of its parent

:nth-last-child()	p:nth-last-child(2)	Selects any <p> element that is the second child of its parent, counting from the end

:nth-last-of-type()	p:nth-last-of-type(2)	Selects any <p> element that is the second <p> element of its parent, counting from the end

:nth-of-type()	p:nth-of-type(2)	Selects any <p> element that is the second <p> element of its parent

:only-child	p:only-child	Selects any <p> element that is the only child of its parent

:only-of-type	p:only-of-type	Selects any <p> element that is the only <p> element of its parent

:visited	a:visited
